This a rule starting point for most agents. The `AGENTS.md` file should guide the agent reading this file first. Then proceed to other special instructions.

## Core Rules

- understand the code and the requirement before making changes
- prefer the smallest correct change over broad rewrites
- follow existing project patterns unless there is a strong reason to change them
- keep code clear, readable, and maintainable
- verify important changes with tests or checks when possible
- never claim something was tested if it was not
- do not overwrite or revert unrelated work
- state assumptions, risks, and limitations clearly
- do not go out-side of the project folder without explicitly asking (once will do)

## Code of Conduct Following Linus's Coding Taste

This is a primary engineering constraint, not a style preference.

### Default Direction

- Prefer simple, direct data flow and control flow. Do not add abstraction layers for theoretical elegance.
- Solve real problems first. Do not pre-build complex frameworks for imagined future cases.
- Eliminate complexity in the design instead of hiding it behind names like manager, factory, or coordinator.

### Must Follow

- Prefer small, clear interfaces.
- Compose existing stable modules first. Do not add universal layers, unified abstraction layers, `Base*` classes, or over-generalized wrappers without a concrete need.
- Prefer better data structures that remove special cases instead of piling on more `if`/`else` branches.
- Names must be plain and precise. They should describe the real semantics, ownership, lifetime, and failure path.
- Do not silently smooth over bad state. When something is invalid, expose where the invariant was broken.
- A new abstraction must prove that it reduces overall complexity. If it only moves complexity around, do not add it.

### Explicitly Discouraged

- Adding architectural layers only to make patterns look uniform.
- Excessive object orientation, inheritance, configuration, or generic abstraction.
- Splitting complex interactions into many weakly related small files.
- Using silent fallbacks, implicit synchronization, or magic defaults to keep the surface looking clean.
- Adding adapters only to avoid changing old code.

## Working Style

Before editing:

- read the relevant files
- look for existing helpers or patterns or code snippets to reuse
- ask if some code snippets potentially can be reused but needs further wrapping
- ask if the task is inconsistencies, ambiguous, risky, or conflicts with project conventions
- ask if some logic can be modularized with more adaptive implementation such as `func` variable or `class_type` variable.
- In python files, trust the type lint.
- Do not write too many protective code. If really necessary, stop and ask the user.

When editing:

- fix the root cause when practical
- avoid unrelated cleanup
- avoid unnecessary dependencies and abstractions
- write code that is easy for the next engineer to understand
- only update the comments if they are inconsistent with the logic

After editing:

- run the smallest useful verification
- update tests or docs if the change needs it
- summarize what changed and anything still uncertain
- if `pre-commit` is configured in the repository, do run `pre-commit run --all-files` to maintain the coding format consistency.

## Ask Before Proceeding

Stop and ask if:

- requirements are unclear
- the change is destructive or hard to reverse
- the task affects security, data, billing, privacy, or production infrastructure
- local user changes create a conflict

## Project Overrides

When copying this into a real repository, customize:

- setup, lint, test, and build commands
- architecture boundaries
- deployment or environment rules
- domain-specific safety requirements
- Ask the user whether the current folder runs on Agent-Host-only computer and note the information in AGENTS.md

---

## Notice for running on the Agent-Host-only computer

- You are not running on the actual task environment. So, do not run the command directly in the local computer.
- Ask for how to connect and run commands on the run-host computer if not known.
- Do Not change the files out side of the project folder on the run-host computer without explicit permission.
- The local `AGENTS.md` file could be different from the `AGENTS.md` file in the project folder on the run-host computer. Take both files into consideration.
